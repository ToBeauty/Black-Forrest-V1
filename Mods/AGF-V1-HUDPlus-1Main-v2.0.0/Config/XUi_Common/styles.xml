<!--MAP IMPROVEMENTS
	Feature: 	Map information moved to its own section next to the map with labels.
	
		Why: 	Many stats and buttons are crammed together and most don't realize they exist.
				Some of the map stats cover up the map.

	Default: 	Subheader of the map is crammed with data and buttons that are hard to identify.
				Map stats are covering the bottom left corner of the map view.
	
	Delete?: 	Safe to remove this section on existing games.
				To remove, delete the sections under windows and styles. Localization can be ignored.
		
	XML's: 		windows, styles, Localization

	Code:		(Localization.txt) Created tooltip_key descriptions of stats not included in default localization.
				(styles.xml) Created an icon style that defaults to red for remove quick waypoint button.
				(windows.xml) Removed the map stats data that is shown ON the bottom left of the map.
				(windows.xml) Removed the subheader that is above the map and below the main header.
				(windows.xml) Created the new panel next to the map of the stats and buttons.
				(windows.xml) Adjusted Map header width to include the new panel.
				(windows.xml) Adjusted position of debug map overlay buttons to account for new header width.
				(windows.xml) Adjusted map view positioning to go where subheader used to be.
