<!--CRAFTING IMPROVEMENT
	Feature: 	Crafting and burning times adjusted for easier viewing.
	
		Why: 	I like readability and sometimes find it hard to differentiate the crafting time and whats behind it.
	
	Default: 	Burn time is  a bright red that for some, is difficult to read.
				Craft time in crafting queue is white with minimal differentiation of what is behind it.
	
	Delete?: 	Safe to remove this section on existing games.
				To remove, delete the sections under windows and controls.
				
	XML's: 		windows, contols
	
	Code:		(windows.xml) Added a line of code of the burning time to adjust the color.
				(controls.xml) Removed original crafting timer set-up.
				(controls.xml) Appended a new timer setting that changes the color and adds a background.

	<!--Removed original crafting timer set-up.-->
		<remove xpath="/controls/recipe_stack/rect/label[@name='timer']"/>
		
	<!--Appended a new timer setting that changes the color and adds a background.-->
		<append xpath="/controls/recipe_stack/rect">
			<label depth="4" name="timer" pos="36,-40" width="70" height="22" font_size="20" justify="center" pivot="center" color="252, 140, 3"><!--Thank you Morph3usx for color suggestion.-->
				<sprite depth="-1" name="timerBackground" pos="-37,12" width="73" height="22" color="0,0,0,255" type="sliced"/>
